## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

In our ongoing commitment to streamline operations, we have chosen to
consolidate all community-developed unofficial Planet organizations (excluding
`Cosmo-CoDiOS` and `Gemian`) into a single, unified entity known as
`planet-community-org`.

This newly formed organization can be accessed [here][new-org], and we are in
the process of launching a new website, which will be available soon. You can
find it [here][website]. Please note that this new entity is not formally
associated with Planet Computers Ltd.

As of 2024-01-04, all repositories within this organization have been
successfully merged into the new structure.

Importantly, this consolidation does not signify a cessation of our welcoming
policy towards Pull Requests (PRs) or the inclusion of other enthusiastic
contributors within our community. On the contrary, we encourage and appreciate
continued engagement.

Moreover, we envision leveraging platforms like OpenCollective to financially
support community projects and sustain our collective efforts.

Looking forward to seeing you there, and heartfelt thanks for your ongoing
support!

[new-org]: https://github.com/planet-community-org
